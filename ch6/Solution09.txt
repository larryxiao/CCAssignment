6.9 100 Lockers: There are 100 closed lockers in a hallway. A man begins by
opening all 100 lockers. Next, he closes every second locker. Then, on his
third pass, he toggles every third locker (closes it if it is open or opens it
if it is closed). This process continues for 100 passes, such that on each pass
i, the man toggles every ith locker. After his 100th pass in the hallway, in
which he toggles only locker #100, how many lockers are open?

For any given door n, it is toggled m times, m equals the number of factors of 
n. For any door to remain open at the end, it it toggled odd number of times.
For any given number, the number of factors is even unless it is a perfect
square.

There are 10 numbers below 100 that are perfect square, 1, 4, 9.., 100. So 
there are 10 lockers open.
