6.8 The Egg Drop Problem: There is a building of 100 floors. If an egg drops
from the Nth floor or aboce, it will break. If it's dropped from any floor
below, it will not break. You're given two eggs. Find N, while minimizing the
number of drops for the worst case.

Attempt 0:
for egg A, drop egg A every 10 floors, from 10...100. if it breaks at n*10th
floor, then try every floor from (n-1)*10 to n*10-1 with egg B. requires at
most 18 times, at least 2 times.

Attempt 1:
In order to reduce the worst-case number of tries, as we make one more try
with egg A, we want to reduce the number of tries for egg B. 
If we start dropping at X floor, the next try should be X-1. So for 100
floor: (X+1)*X/2 = 100 => X = 14.
So the drop pattern is: 
Egg A: (0+14) 14, (+13) 27, (+12) 39 ...
This way for all cases, the number of tries won't exceed 14.
