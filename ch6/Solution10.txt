6.10 Poison: You have 1000 bottles of soda, and exactly one is poisoned. You
have 10 test strips which can be used to detect poison. A single drop of poison
will turn the test strip positive permanently. You can put any number of drops
on a test strip at once and you can reuse a test strip as many times as you'd
like (as long as the results are regative). However, you can only run tests
once per day and it takes seven days to return a result. How would you figure
out the poisoned bottle in as few days as possible?

Attempt 0:
first test: 10 test strips each take samples from 100 bottles => which 100
bottles contains the poisoned bottle. (1 test strip is consumed)
second test: 9 test strips each take 10 sample from the 100 bottles => which 10
bottles contains the poisoned bottle. (1 test strip is consumed)
third test:  (how to encode 10 bottles in 8 bits)

Attempt 1:
2^10 = 1024, so use the 10 test strips to encode the 1000 bottles.
eg. for the nth bottle, put samples from the bottle to the 10 test strips as
its binary representation.
after one test, the bit pattern reveil the poisoned bottle number.
