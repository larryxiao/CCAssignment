6.5 Jugs of Water: You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug and an
unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with
exactly four quarts of water?  Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that
filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

format: *water inside*/*five-quart jug* *water inside*/*three-quart jug* 5/5
0/3 -> 2/5 3/3 -> 3/5 0/3 -> 5/5 1/3 -> 4/5 0/3
