6.7 The Apocalypse: In the new post-apocalyptic world, the world queen is
desperately concerned about the birth rate. Therefore, she decrees that all
families should ensure that they have one girl or else they face massive fines.
If all families abide by this policy -- that is, they have continue to have
children until they have one girl, at which point they immediately stop -- what
will the gender ratio of the new generation be? (Assume that the odds of
someone having a boy or a girl on any given pregnancy is equal.)
Solve this out logically and then write a computer simulation of it.

The probability P of a family having n boys before a girl (n = 0..infinite)
P=(1/2)^(n+1)

The number of girls G. G = sigma(P) (n = 0..infinite)
The number of boys B. B = sigma(P*n) (n = 0..infinite)

The ratio: G:B = 1
