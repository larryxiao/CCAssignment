6.3 Dominos: There is an 8x8 chessboard in which two diagonally opposite corners
have been cut off. You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover
exactly two squares. Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board?
Prove your answer (by providing an example or showing why it's possible)

The basic shapes dominos can form:
00 001 00 001
11 221 11 221
22 33     344
          355

It's impossible to fill the board. If you place a single domino to the board, it
covers a black square and a white square, so it needs to have equal number of
black and white squares to be able to fill the board. 
However, taking the cornes will take away two same color squares, making it
impossible to fill.
